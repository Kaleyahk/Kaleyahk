    <h3>"No matter how big a nation is, it is no stronger than its weakest people, and as long as you keep a person down, some part of you has to be down there to hold him down, so it means you cannot soar as you might otherwise."</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: Marian Anderson</span>
    <p>#BlackLivesMatter was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer. Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a global organization in the US, UK, and Canada, whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes. By combating and countering acts of violence, creating space for Black imagination and innovation, and centering Black joy, we are winning immediate improvements in our lives.</p>

    <p>TBLM activists have held large and influential protests in cities across the United States as well as internationally. A decentralized grassroots movement, Black Lives Matter is led by activists in local chapters who organize their own campaigns and programs. The chapters are affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, a nonprofit civil rights organization that is active in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>

      <h2>""It is said that no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones."</h2>

    <p>"Time and again, racist ideas have not been cooked up from the boiling pot of ignorance and hate. Time and again, powerful and brilliant men and women have produced racist ideas in order to justify the racist policies of their era, in order to redirect the blame for their era’s racial disparities away from those policies and onto Black people."</p>

    <p>The movement also works to help end violence toward Black people. Injustice toward Black people has been going on for a long time. One example is police brutality. Several Black people have been killed by the police. In 2020 a man named George Floyd was unjustly killed by the police. The Black Lives Matter movement organized protests in cities throughout the world, and these protests helped to identify the need for justice and change. For example, police officers were charged in Floyd’s death. Cities began to look at how to change unfair police practices. The movement has caused people to talk about how to make the world a more just and equal place for people of color.</p>
